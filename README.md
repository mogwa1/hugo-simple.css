# hugo-simple.css
A [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) website that's based on [Simple.css](https://simplecss.org/).

This repository contains the Hugo code that you would end up with after following the tutorial blog posts: [here](https://mogwai.be/creating-a-simple.css-site-with-hugo/) and [here](https://mogwai.be/adding-an-rss-feed).

These tutorials are based upon an [original post](https://kevq.uk/how-to-build-jekyll-site-simple-css/) showing how to set up a [Simple.css](https://simplecss.org/) website using Jekyll.
